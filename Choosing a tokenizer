Given the following string, which of the below patterns is the best tokenizer? If possible, you want to retain 
sentence punctuation as separate tokens, but have '#1' remain a single token.

my_string = "SOLDIER #1: Found them? In Mercea? The coconut's tropical!"
The string is available in your workspace as my_string, and the patterns have been pre-loaded as pattern1, 
pattern2, pattern3, and pattern4, respectively.

Additionally, regexp_tokenize has been imported from nltk.tokenize. You can use regexp_tokenize() with my_string 
and one of the patterns as arguments to experiment for yourself and see which is the best tokenizer.

Answer: r"(\w+|#\d|\?|!)"
